# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CopperForge! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand the platform. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Author's Note
My main concern regarding contributions is not to have incessant "post-hoc" critiques by me on your code. I want to encourage you to contribute, and I will not be overly critical of your code. I will, however, provide feedback on how to improve the codebase, but this is not a "code review" in the traditional sense. My main focus will be to vet the
idea to make sure it aligns with the project's goals and vision. If you have a feature or bug fix in mind, please feel free to submit it, and I will work with you to refine it as needed.



## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the CopperForge repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're happy with your changes, submit a pull request to the main repository.    
5. **Describe Your Changes**: In your pull request, provide a clear description of what you have done and why. Include any relevant issue numbers.
6. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and style guidelines. This helps maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in the repository.
Provide as much detail as possible, including:
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs if applicable

## Specific Areas for Contribution
- **Documentation**: Help improve the documentation by fixing typos, adding examples, or clarifying instructions.
- **Features**: Implement new features or enhancements. Check the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for ideas.
- **Bug Fixes**: Look for open issues labeled as "bug" and help resolve them.
- **Testing**: Write tests for existing or new features to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Performance Improvements**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in the application.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Help improve the user interface and user experience by suggesting or implementing design changes.
