CopperForge is a modern EDA platform designed to optimize every phase of PCB development, from initial design through manufacturing. Built with Rust and egui, it delivers fast, memory-safe operations with real-time rendering performance.

**Key capabilities include:**
- PCB design rule checking and optimization
- **Real-time bill of materials (BOM) with live KiCad integration**
- Component placement analysis with coordinate display
- CAM operations for manufacturing preparation

CopperForge serves as a **companion tool to KiCad**, running alongside KiCad PCB to provide enhanced insights during design and streamline manufacturing preparation. 

The application leverages proven Rust ecosystem libraries including `gerber_types`, `gerber_parser`, and `gerber_viewer` from the `MakerPnP` project, plus the `egui_mobius` stack with `egui_lens` for reactive state management and event logging.

What sets CopperForge apart is its focus on algorithmic PCB manufacturing optimization within a memory-safe, multi-threaded environment. 

Shown below is the loading of a PCB design with over 400+ components, where the KiCad PCB design is loaded, the gerbers are generated within the tool, and the display is updated.

## Key Features

- **Gerber Import & Visualization**: Import and view multi-layer Gerber files with support for all standard PCB layers
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)** *(Improvements in Progress)*: Run comprehensive manufacturing checks to catch issues before production
- **Panelization Support** *(Work in Progress)*: Optimize PCB panel layouts to maximize material usage and reduce manufacturing costs
- **Real-time BOM Generation**: Live component data display with direct KiCad IPC communication for assembly preparation

## Current Capabilities

- Multi-layer Gerber viewing with support for:
  - Copper layers (Top/Bottom)
  - Silkscreen layers
  - Solder mask layers
  - Solder paste layers
  - Board outline
  - Drill files
- Interactive layer controls with visibility toggles
- Grid overlay for measurement and alignment
- Zoom and pan controls for detailed inspection
- **Real-time BOM tab with live component data from running KiCad instance**
- Component filtering and search functionality
- Export-ready coordinate display for pick-and-place operations

## Real-time BOM Integration

CopperForge features a powerful real-time Bill of Materials (BOM) system that communicates directly with a running KiCad instance through IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This provides live component data for assembly and manufacturing preparation.

### BOM Features:
- **Live KiCad Integration**: Direct communication with KiCad PCB via IPC protocol
- **Real-time Updates**: Component data refreshes automatically as you modify your design in KiCad
- **Comprehensive Component Data**: Item number, reference designator, value, footprint, and description
- **Precise Coordinates**: X/Y position and rotation angle for pick-and-place operations
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search and filter components by reference, value, footprint, or description
- **Multiple Units**: Display coordinates in either millimeters or mils
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for KiCad connection status
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable refresh intervals for live updates
- **Thread-safe Architecture**: Built with `egui_mobius` signal/slot pattern for responsive UI

### Usage:
1. Open your PCB design in KiCad
2. Launch CopperForge and navigate to the BOM tab
3. Click "Connect" to establish live communication with KiCad
4. View real-time component data with filtering and search capabilities
5. Use coordinate data for pick-and-place machine programming

## Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.65.0 or higher (see [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for installation)
- **KiCad**: 9.0+ (for PCB file import functionality)
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atlantix-EDA/CopperForge.git
   cd CopperForge
   ```

2. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Load a PCB file:** Use File â†’ Open to load a KiCad `.kicad_pcb` file
2. **View layers:** Toggle layer visibility using the layer controls panel
3. **Real-time BOM:** Open KiCad with your PCB, then use the BOM tab to connect and view live component data
4. **Run DRC:** Access Design Rule Check from the DRC panel
5. **Adjust settings:** Configure grid, orientation, and view options

### Supported File Formats

- KiCad PCB files (`.kicad_pcb`)
- Gerber files (`.gbr`, `.ger`)
- Excellon drill files (`.drl`)
- Pick and place files (`.csv`)
